- I'm pretty sure there's a better algorithm for day six part 2.
  I suspect there's a way to figure out the loops without simulating every single block addition.
  Or maybe a way to prune the search space.
- Day 7 Part 1 could probably be faster if, instead of generating all of the possible values for an equation,
  we generate them one by one and as soon as we find one that works, we stop looking.
